## Project Description
Shared Augmented Reality or multi-user augmented reality, allows multiple users to share a synchronized augmented space. Users see the same digital content simultaneously, creating a shared social experience that engages the users with the content, and with each other.  Each user can view the digital content from their own perspective – a user on one side of the room may see the front, while a user on the other side sees the rear. 

Tthe primary goal of this project is to demonstrate shared augmented reality through the medium of a mobile application. The mobile application is intended to be used by architects and their clients as a means of promoting communication and collaboration between these parties.

The system is composed of three primary components, a cross-platform mobile application for viewing and sharing architectural models using AR, a database for storing augmented reality models and sessions and finally, a CRUD web application for managing and uploading models to the database. 

## Running the Mobile Application
The mobile application is packaged as an Android application. The .APK is located in the AR-  `Application/ProjectCode/MobileApp` directory of this project. The APK can be transferred to an Android device and installed via the device's instructions. 

## Running the web application

 1. [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/) for Node.js 6 or greater.
 2. nstall the ionic CLI globally: `npm install -g ionic`
 3. Git Clone this repository to your local machine
``` 
git clone [https://github.com/DaireNiC/AR-Application](https://github.com/DaireNiC/AR-Application)
```
 4. Change directory into the project code folder
``` 
cd AR-Application/ProjectCode/WebApp
```
 5.  Run `npm install` from the project root.
```
Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
```
