# Augmented Reality Application

This repo is a compilation of the research and progress for my final year software development project. 

# Exploration 
Mixed reality, which includes both virtual and augmented, is an area in tech making significant progress in recent years. The goal of this project is to explore the state of the field in augmented reality. 

## Progress 

|Week|   |
|--|--|
| 1-3 | Research into areas of technology suitable for the project. Focusing on AR. Exploring the state of the field in AR. Comparing different libraries available. 
4 | Create a hello world application using google's ARCore Library. 
5 | Investigate and implement geolocation based AR

## Weeks 1-3

### Project Idea Research

 1.  Researched different areas of interest suitable for the project.
	 - IOT 
		 -  Explored applications of Raspberry pi + Arduino
	 - VR 
		 - Using Unity/C# + Blender to create an app for Oculus Go/GearVR
	 - AR 
		 - Mobile application using latest AR technologies
	 - AI
		 - Mobile application using tensorflow lite + ReactNative 

### AR focused project
- Decided to chose augmented reality with a focus on creating a mobile application as my project.
- Researched state of the field 
- Explored AR libraries available 
	- ARCore, ARKit, ViroReact
	- Looked at projects created using these libraries 
 - Researched Tools needed
	 - Android/C#, 3D modelling (Blender/Sketchup)
