# BirdAR
Nest visibility is one of the primary difficulties encountered in bird conservation projects. Locating and monitoring the nests of birds in beach colonies in particular, is a delicate task. 

**Why?**
- Seabirds birds use very little material in their nests, making them indistinguishable from the rocky shoreline
- Physical Markers cannot be placed near nests as this can disturb the birds

 **The result**
 - Nests are extremely difficult to locate and monitor
 - Nests can be destroyed by workers accidentally stepping on them
 - Chicks/eggs can also get stepped on
 
## The Solution 
BirdAR is a mobile application that uses augmented reality to help bird conservationists in their field of work.

**Features** 
 - Uses AR to display markers of where bird nests are located. 
 - Allows users to add a marker in the given location if a new nest is discovered
 - Store information on the nest, e.g egg count, reported incidents

## Use Case
### Kilcoole Little Tern Conservation Project
A colony of Little Terns, one of Irelandâ€™s rarest breeding seabirds, nests on the shingle beach between Kilcoole and Newcastle, Co Wicklow. A section of the beach, consisting of roughly 500 meters is fenced off from the public, reserving it exclusively for the Little Terns during the summer months. Wardens monitor the beach, counting and marking nests, ringing chicks and keeping track of egg numbers.

> Little Tern eggs are extremely difficult to spot

**How nests are currently marked**

- Note how the nest marker must be placed a small distance away from the actual nest.
- This further increases the difficulty in locating it.

#  Project Development  
Mixed reality, which includes both virtual and augmented, is an area in tech making significant progress in recent years. The goal of this project is to explore the state of the field in augmented reality. 

## Progress 

|Week|   |
|--|--|
| 1-3 | Research into areas of technology suitable for the project. Focusing on AR. Exploring the state of the field in AR. Comparing different libraries available. 
4 | Create a hello world application using google's ARCore Library. 
5 | Investigate geolocation based AR. 

## Weeks 1-3

### Project Idea Research

 1.  Researched different areas of interest suitable for the project.
	 - IOT 
		 -  Explored applications of Raspberry pi + Arduino
	 - VR 
		 - Using Unity/C# + Blender to create an app for Oculus Go/GearVR
	 - AR 
		 - Mobile application using latest AR technologies
	 - AI
		 - Mobile application using tensorflow lite + ReactNative 

### AR focused project
- Decided to chose augmented reality with a focus on creating a mobile application as my project.
- Researched state of the field 
- Explored AR libraries available 
	- ARCore, ARKit, ViroReact
	- Looked at projects created using these libraries 
 - Researched Tools needed
	 - Android/C#, 3D modelling (Blender/Sketchup)
